## Batch System Info
Welcome! You can see the COMPLETE information about your operating system and some of it's hardware just by running a batch script! For now, this is a half-true statement. It's just a goal. In this file you will have the main release notes, and other goodies.
## What am I planning?

 - A script to list all the information about your operating system
 - When the project becomes at least known to other people migrate it to another programming language
 ## How to run it?
 download the repository as a .zip file and run the prog.bat file
 ## How can I help?
 Add other and some complex commands I forgot. You can also highlight any issues that occur.
